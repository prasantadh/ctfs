The challenge relies on finding modular inverse. For given integers `a` and `m`, `x` is said to be the modular inverse of `a` and `m` if `(a*x) % m = 1`. In our situation, `a*x mod m = c`. We just need to note `(a *inv(a, m) *c) % m = c` to solve the problem. That is `x = inv(a, m) * c`. However, the developers inserted a little trick and you need to do `x = (inv(a, m) *c) % m` to get the correct flag. I wrote a python script to print out the flag:

```python
def inverse(a, m):
	mm = m 
	y = 0
	x = 1
	if (m == 1) :
		return 0
	while (a > 1) :
		# q is quotient 
		q = a // m
		t = m
		# m is remainder now, process 
		# same as Euclid's algo 
		m = a % m
		a = t
		t = y
		# Update x and y
		y = x - q * y
		x = t
		# Make x positive
	if (x < 0) :
		x = x + mm

	return x

with open('assets/lineq.txt') as f:
	content = f.readlines()
	f.close()
	content = content[:-1]
	content = [line.strip() for line in content]
	for line in content:
		line = line.split(' ');
		inv = inverse(int(line[0]), int(line[4]))
		x = (inv * int(line[6])) % int(line[4])
		print(chr(x % 256), end='')
```

```tex
Challenge: SHA256 is safe, the cipher is not?
```

We are given a cipher text and the file used to encrypt the text.

```python
#-*- coding:utf-8 -*-

import os
from hashlib import sha256

def H(v):
    return int(sha256(str(v)).hexdigest(), 16)

def STEP(v):
    return (31338 * v**3 + 17 * v**2 + 2017 * v + 10) % 2**256

def encrypt(pt, key):
    state = H(key)
    ct = ""
    for c in pt:
        c = ord(c)
        for i in xrange(32):
            op = state % 4
            state = STEP(state)

            v = state % 256
            state = STEP(state)

            if op == 0:
                c = (c + v) % 256
            elif op == 1:
                c = (c ^ v) % 256
            elif op == 2:
                c = (c - v) % 256
            elif op == 3:
                c = (c * (v | 1)) % 256
        state ^= c
        ct += chr(c)
    return ct


print encrypt(open("flag.txt").read().strip(), os.urandom(32)).encode("hex")
## ciphertext: 868c017b7bef15e04ccc5f2d6b4c372fdff881080155
```

After a bit of playing around, we noticed that `op` was only producing `0` or `2` after the first random value. We also noticed that `STEP` function had a cycle and also always returned an even number. Both of these were observations that did not help.

[wleightond](https://github.com/wleightond) had the hunch that perhaps as long as we keep the final byte of the key constant, the subsequent final bytes were going to be the same on the output of the `STEP` function. So we verified it:

```python
 import os
 from hashlib import sha256
 
 ct = "868c017b7bef15e04ccc5f2d6b4c372fdff881080155".decode('hex')
 
 def H(v):
     return int(sha256(str(v)).hexdigest(), 16)
 
 def STEP(v):
     return (31338 * v**3 + 17 * v**2 + 2017 * v + 10) % 2**256
 
 # verify suspicion that as long as the last byte is the same
 # the step function will give us exactly the same sequence
 # of last bytes afterwards
 x = H(os.urandom(32))
 y = x % 256
 for i in range(100):
     if STEP(x) % 256 != STEP(y) % 256:
         print "wrong direction"
 print "suspicion verified"
```

From here, we knew that the first four bytes probably were `flag`. We could use that information to get the initial state. So we did.

```python
l = [encrypt('flag', i).encode('hex') for i in range(0, 256)]
l.index('868c017b')
```

This raised a `ValueError` because none of the initial state encrypted the text to that value. So we tried a little tweak.

```python
l = [encrypt('flag', i).encode('hex') for i in range(0, 256)]
l.index('868c017b')
```

This worked! The initial state was `47`.  So we wrote a script to brute force the rest of the flag.

```python
### ....
def encrypt(pt):
    state = 47
	### ...
ct = "868c017b7bef15e04ccc5f2d6b4c372fdff881080155".decode('hex')
pt = 'FLAG{'
while len(pt) < len(ct):
    c = chr(32)
    while encrypt(pt + c) != ct[:len(pt) + 1]: ## here you have to run the check for 
        ## for whole string (and not just single character) due to collision issue
        c = chr(ord(c) + 1)
    pt += c
print(pt)
```

Caveat: Use `python2` for running all programs.

	for rno in xrange(32):

		a, b, c, d = c ^ F(d | F(b ^ F(a)) ^ F(d | b) ^ a), b ^ F(d ^ F(a) ^ (d | a)), a ^ F(d | F(d) ^ d), d ^ 1337
	return pack("<4I", a, b, c, d)

pt = open(sys.argv[1]).read()

ct = "".join(encrypt(pt[i:i+16]) for i in xrange(0, len(pt), 16))

```

It's a Feistel Network and hence the name **gen**eralized **fei**stel. Basically chain rule. We can start by decrypting the d in the second step of encryption. From there it is easy to follow the chain and undo it. Here's the python script to decrypt the flag:

```python
## run with python2
from struct import pack, unpack

def F(w):
    return ((w * 31337) ^ (w * 1337 >> 16)) % 2**32

def decrypt(block):
    a, b, c, d = unpack("<4I", block)
    for i in xrange(32):
        # decrypting the second step in encrypt
        tempa = a
        d = d ^ 1337
        a = c ^ (F(d | F(d) ^ d))
        b = b ^ (F(d ^ F(a) ^ (d | a)))
        c = tempa ^ (F(d | F(b ^ F(a)) ^ F(d | b) ^ a))
        # decrypting the frist step in encrypt
        tempa = a
        a = d ^ 31337
        d = c ^ (F(a | F(a) ^ a))
        c = b ^ (F(a ^ F(d) ^ (a | d)))
        b = tempa ^ (F(a | F(c ^ F(d)) ^ F(a | c) ^ d))
    return pack("<4I", a, b, c, d)

ct = open("flag.enc").read()
pt = "".join(decrypt(ct[i:i+16]) for i in xrange(0,len(ct), 16))

```tex
Challenge: sseemga si dsenarotps?
```
We are given a cipher text and the file used to encrypt the text.

```python

#-*- coding:utf-8 -*-

import random

W = 7
perm = range(W)
random.shuffle(perm)

msg = open("flag.txt").read().strip()
while len(msg) % (2*W):
    msg += "."

for i in xrange(100):
    msg = msg[1:] + msg[:1]
    msg = msg[0::2] + msg[1::2]
    msg = msg[1:] + msg[:1]
    res = ""
    for j in xrange(0, len(msg), W):
        for k in xrange(W):
            res += msg[j:j+W][perm[k]]
    msg = res
print msg
```
My first relieve after figuring out what the code does was that no sort of **IV**(of course this is no AES sh*t) or **salting** is being done with the data, which means that the entire encryption process is deterministic, that is, repeat it 100 times and the same input and key sequence will give same output. and if we look at the ciphertext:**L{NTP#AGLCSF.#OAR4A#STOL11__}PYCCTO1N#RS.S** , we see that it's just the jumbled up flag (we can see the characters "{}LAGF" which gives us an hint that it's probably the normal flag format:**FLAG{...}**).

Encrypt process tells us that "." is appended to the initial plaintext to ensure it's a multiple of 7.

Since ciphertext contains two "." character and it's length is 42, i assume the initial plaintext(flag) length is 40 and the two "." were added to compensate, of course this approach breaks down(a litle) if the initial plaintext itself contains "." characters as we won't be able to straightforwardly determine how many "." were appended, as there's no easy way to know the number of "." characters that are part of the initial plaintext, and no easy way to know the number of "." characters that were appended to the initial plaintext to form the final plaintext, one way to figure it out would be trial and error method of assuming the number(X) of "." chars appended|included in the final|initial plaintext respectively! starting at no. 1, then increasing by 1 as you go(search space is effectively 0 > X ≤ number of "." chars present in ciphertext, in our own case 2 "." chars). but am lucky and my assumption was right. 

```tex
Knowing this, i decided to try out a **chosen plaintext attack** with plaintext:**"FLAG{lets_find_a_kind_of_reverse_logic_}.."**(length is already multiple of 7).

The goal is to match the indexes of known chars in the given ciphertext, to known chars in my derived ciphertext where known chars are **"{}LAGF.."**.
```
So i wrote a script to bruteforce the key sequence:

```python
#-*- coding:utf-8 -*-

import random
import itertools

W = 7
perm = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
perm2 = []
output = open('qq.txt', 'wt')
l = itertools.permutations(perm, 7)

for pack in l:
	res=""
	msg = "FLAG{lets_find_a_kind_of_reverse_logic_}.." #Known plaintext attack!!! FLAG{----------------------------------}..
	perm = list(pack)
	for i in range(100):
	    msg = msg[1:] + msg[:1]
	    msg = msg[0::2] + msg[1::2]
	    msg = msg[1:] + msg[:1]
	    res = ""
	    for j in range(0, len(msg), W):
	        for k in range(W):
	            res += msg[j:j+W][perm[k]]
	    msg = res
	print(msg, perm)
	# output.writelines(f"res[{msg}]		perm[{perm}]\n\n")
	#L{ NTP#AGLC S F  . #OAR4A#STOL11__ } PYCCTO1N#RS . S  --> given ciphertext
	#0:2             12                28            40
	if msg[12] == "." and msg[40] == "." and msg[0:2] == "L{" and msg[28] == "}":
		print("key sequence match found! ", perm)
		output.writelines(f"match found! ...res[{msg}]		 perm[{perm}]\n\n")
		perm2 = perm
		exit(1)
```
Yes!, now that we have the correct key sequence**(3, 2, 5, 6, 0, 4, 1) that produced the original ciphertext, all that's left is to append code that reverses the encryption process, giving us our well deserved flag!!

```python

for z in range(100):
	char = []
	res=""
	for x in range(42):
		char.append(" ")
	for x in range(0,42,7):
		sl = msg[x:x+7]
		for y,z in enumerate(sl):
			char[perm2[y]+x] = z
	msg = "".join(char)
	msg = msg[-1::]+msg[:-1]
	for x in range(0,len(msg),21):
		slc = msg[x:x+21]
		if x == 0:
			print("slice even - ",slc)
			count = 0
			for y in slc:
				char[count] = y
				count += 2
		if x == 21:
			print("slice odd - ",slc)
			count = 1
			for y in slc:
				char[count] = y
				count += 2

	msg = "".join(char)
	msg = msg[-1::]+msg[:-1]
print(msg)

```
And there you have it!, but beware, it took me around 25hours(total) to solve this (yes, am dumb, i know).
